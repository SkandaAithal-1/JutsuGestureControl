# Proposal

## Gesture Control Drone

## Abstract

Imagine being able to control drone using intuitive hand gestures. This is the vision behind the project. We plan to make the control of the drone as easy as waving your hands. Sounds cool, does it not?

## Workflow

- First we will start with the recognition of gestures. We plan to use [Mediapipe Solutions](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide) to help with gesture recognitions.
- Then we will implement the controls using the recognised gestures in a simulation. We will be using Ardupilot and Gazebo to achieve this.
- Later we will use a static camera to control a real drone.
- Then we can move on to an on-board camera. This will be challenging because we would also have to work on gesture recognition again since the camera will also be moving.

## Timeline

- **1 week** : First implementation of gesture recognition.
- **1 week** : Implementing this on simulation.
- **2 weeks** : Usage of static camera to control the drone.
- **3 weeks** : Using an on-board camera to achieve the controls.
